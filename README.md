...In translation from fKdV4
============================

pyfKdV is a fortran 95 propagator wrapped in python through cython compiler.

__In active development__:

 * TLM nor adjoint implemented in this version
 * nor Lanczos, singular vector calculation
 * fKdV4 is my stable version for now. It is an (almost) Object-orientated Fortran 95 integrator for the Korteweg de-Vries differential equation.  It also contain a (kind of) wrapper in python, but it is very clumsy (passing everything by file transfer between python and fortran...)

It aims at calculating singular vectors using Lanczos algorithm.
